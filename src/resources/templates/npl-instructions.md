When working with NPL (Noumena Protocol Language) files:

1. NPL is a domain-specific language for the Noumena Protocol, a blockchain protocol focused on programmable assets
2. NPL uses a unique syntax for defining protocol types and operations
3. All NPL files have the .npl extension
4. Follow the existing code style when suggesting NPL code
5. Respect the type system - NPL is strongly typed
